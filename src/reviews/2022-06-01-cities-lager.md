Ah, a great beer to drink on the back porch with your neighbors at the height of summer. Okay, so my back porch is really just a stairwell that my neighbors squeezed some chairs on and probably created fire code problems, but nevertheless, this was a great beer to drink while watching the sun go down, reminiscing about 2020 COVID isolation times.

Poured golden-clear into a standard pint glass with plenty of bubbles. Light, clean, refreshing, there is a sort of sweet cereal taste with a grassy hop finish. Very easy drinking and could go well with any meal.
