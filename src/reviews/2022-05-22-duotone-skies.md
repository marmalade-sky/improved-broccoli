I don't drink a lot of hazys or juicys since I gravitate towards lower ABV beers these days, but on a warm summer day when I'm eating a meat and cheese plate with a side of fresh fruit because it's too darn hot to turn the oven on in my A/C-less apartment, one of these will really hit the spot.

This beer poured a beautiful bright orange into a Spiegelau IPA glass with a firm, creamy head and piney aromas. Upon tasting, there is a citrus explosion, a deliciously thick mouthfeel, followed by a nice resinous finish. A really solid beer from Phase Three. I look forward to sharing the other cans with friends.
