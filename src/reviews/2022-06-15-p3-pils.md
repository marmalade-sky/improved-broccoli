description: Lightly-hopped to provide balance to the malt. This beer isn’t hoppy, it isn’t malty, it’s simple at its core and the perfect companion to hiking, grilling, sitting by the pool, or enjoying in a hammock.

The little bottle shop in my neighborhood started carrying Phase Three beer and I was excited to try this easy-drinking pilsner. As said in the description, it's subtly hopped and pretty well-balanced. It poured a clear, pretty amber color into pilsner glass with a sudsy head that quickly fades. There are aroma notes of bread and grain with a crisp taste that isn't too bitter. A nice beer for a summer day. Dare I say, almost crushable.
