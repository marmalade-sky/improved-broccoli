I drank my first can of Boat Shoes during the terrible Chicago heatwave in June of 2022. Remember that day? It was 99 degrees with 80% humidity because of that Sunday night storm that had eerie tornado sirens blaring for over an hour. I wasn't going to turn on the oven to cook dinner in an apartment with no A/C, so I do what I always do when this happens: I make a cheese plate and charcuterie board.
 
Poured into a traditional pint glass because I was too hot to care, it was like clear, liquid gold. There was a sudsy head that quickly dissipated. Crisp, light, slightly dry, and most importantly, COLD, this malt-forward beer had some slight citrus taste to it as well. I hope that wasn't a hallucination. I also realize the heat may have made this review pretty skewed, but it did satisfy on one of the worst-weather days of 2022 thus far.
