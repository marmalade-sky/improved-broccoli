description: With a moderate amount of bitterness and a crisp dry finish, this light, malt-forward KÃ¶lsch is made for leisure. It might be what a fool believes, but we think that peaceful, easy feeling is more of a mindset than anything a rich girl can buy.

I drank my first can of Boat Shoes during the terrible Chicago heatwave in June of 2022. It was 99 degrees with somewhere like 80% humidity. I wasn't going to turn on the oven to cook dinner in an apartment with no A/C, so I do what I always do when this happens: I make a cheese plate and charcuterie board.
 
Poured into a Nonic pint glass, it was like clear, liquid gold. There was a sudsy head that quickly dissipated. Crisp, light, slightly dry, and most importantly, COLD, this malt-forward beer had some slight citrus taste to it as well. I hope that wasn't a hallucination. It really did satisfy on one of the worst-weather days of 2022 thus far.
