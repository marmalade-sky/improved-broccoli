Probably an odd thing to note, but when I find beers in 12 oz. cans rather than the 16 oz. bigger boys, I'm a happy camper. With that random tidbit aside, I had this beer on taco night, sort of pretending I got the tacos from a food truck rather than my kitchen. Imagination kind of worked. This beer poured a clear gold into a standard pint glass with a classic white head. There are light, yeasty aromas in the nose and mellow bready-yeasty taste on the tongue. Pretty alright with my taco plate but wouldn't go out of my way to purchase again.
