description: Our take on the delicate and sublime beer of Cologne, this one rewards casual sipping and more introspective pours alike. Itâ€™s nuanced, unhypeable, and we absolutely love it. Drink it and be awesomely uncool!

Okay, I'm a little biased: kolsch is one of my favorite styles of beer, so I'm always pumped to try a new one. The can poured like liquid sun into a stange glass, creating a sudsy white head with lovely lacing. The aromas of grain and bread give way to a nice malty taste with herbal hop notes. Nice and light, refreshing and easy-drinking!
