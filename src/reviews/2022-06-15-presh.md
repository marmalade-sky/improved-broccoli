Whenever I find a lower-ABV hazy, my heart leaps with joy. It poured a nice hazy orange-gold with a nice white head. Nice lacing. There is a really nice citrus taste (you can really pick up on the OJ!) with a gentle body and mouthfeel. Finishes with a hint of those floral notes. Definitely not too heavy or creamy. A really good hazy that isn't a double IPA where one 16 oz. can will pretty much wreck me.
